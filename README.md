So For The Things Mentioned Below Please Refer To Their Manuals Before Starting Blindly. I Myself Have Experienced The Pain From r/unixporn README For The Sake Of That I Will Include Links To All The Resources Possible.
### Before jumping in I wanna remind you that For this to work you either have to put Wallpapers (For which you want color schemes from) In   <br />
### ~/Pictures/Pywal/ 
### or either change the path for the wallpapers in <br /> 
### ~/.config/wal/pywal.sh

## First Bspwm <br />
Just copy and paste if you already have a Bspwm & sxhkd configs and or up and running if you don't <br />
### then <br />
### (Note: Do not copy the $) <br />
$ mkdir ~/.config (only if you don't have one) <br />
$ mkdir ~/.config/bspwm <br />
cd into my dotfiles and again cd into bspwm then <br />
$ cp -r  bspwmrc resize ~/.config/bspwm <br />
### (Note: DO NOT FORGET) <br />
$ chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc <br />
##  Sxhkd  <br />
### edit it to your liking | Mine has some minor changes and stuff | Everything is commented <br />
$ mkdir ~/.config/sxhkd <br />
cd into my dotfiles and again cd into sxhkd then <br />

### (Note: DO NOT FORGET) <br />
$ chmod +x ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc <br />

### If you don't run it than the colors will never change on (super + p) <br />
## [Fish] <br />
$ sudo pacman -Syyu fish
cd again into my dots <br />
### this time for the fish shell IF YOUR using bash which is default please refer to Pywal for Bash <br />
For the fish shell after installing cd into my dotsfiles and cp -r fish ~/.config/ <br />
if you don't copy the whole folder than the annoying fish_greeting message and {fish wal command not found} errors will haunt you <br />
